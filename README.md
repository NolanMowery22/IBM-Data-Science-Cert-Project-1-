# IBM-Data-Science-Cert-Project-1-
Beginner project from the IBM Data Science Certifciate via Course Era. Provides practice working with jupyter notebook, markdown cells, commands, etc. and uploading to github 
There was an issue with the Jupyter notebook via the skills lab that would not allow me to download the full code, so I downloaded the ipynb via Google Colab.
